            Hello, I am Will Farrell not the comedian but the "Coach", and Football is my life.
         Initially, I started my coaching when my oldest son started playing youth sports.
         Although it was Flag Football and not tackle, I loved teaching my kids the basic
         fundamentals of the game. Lastly, thats how my Football Life began with coaching.
